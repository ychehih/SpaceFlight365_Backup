 <p>This managed solution contains a JavaScript web resource: <strong>SDK.DuplicateDetection.js</strong> (sample_/duplicateDetection/scripts/SDK.DuplicateDetection.js) 
     which includes a function that can be set in the <strong>OnSave</strong> event of main or quick create forms to implement duplicate detection checking when records on entities that
     are configured for duplicate detection are created.
 </p>
    <p><strong>SDK.DuplicateDetection.js</strong> depends other HTML web resource to provide the user interface to show any duplicate records that are discovered. This HTML web resource
        and a supporting JavaScript web resource must be created for each entity. This solution contains some examples that have been create for the <strong>Contact</strong> and <strong>Lead</strong> system 
        entities as well as for a custom entity named <strong>Duplicate Detect Test</strong>.
