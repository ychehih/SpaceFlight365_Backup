SERVICE REFERENCES
Add the following service references, using your server name:

1) Example URL: https://myserver/XRMServices/2011/Discovery.svc
   Namespace: CrmSdk.Discovery
2) Example URL: https://myserver/XRMServices/2011/Organization.svc
   Namespace: CrmSdk

If you don't know the URL for the services, do the following:
1) Launch the CRM Application in Internet Explorer
2) Navigate to Settings -> Customizations
3) Click Developer Resources
4) Note down the URL for the Discovery Service and the Organization Service.

CONFIGURATION FILE CHANGES
1) In the "<binding name="CustomBinding_IOrganizationService">" node, locate the "<issuer ...>" node.
   This node allows the user to specify which Issuer should be used when issuing a token. The various 
   STS endpoints will be present in the commented out "alternativeIssuedTokenParameters" node. In my
   example, KerberosMixed is used. In order to use KerberosMixed, the "binding" and "bindingConfiguration"
   attributes need to be updated to match the node in "alternativeIssuedTokenParameters". The easiest
   way to find this endpoint is to search for "https://adfs.contoso.com:555/adfs/services/trust/13/kerberosmixed".
   
   In the generated configuration file, you'll find: 
   <issuer address="https://adfs.contoso.com:555/adfs/services/trust/13/kerberosmixed" 
           bindingConfiguration="https://adfs.contoso.com:555/adfs/services/trust/13/kerberosmixed" 
		   binding="customBinding" />

   Copy this node and replace the current issuer node in the "<binding name="CustomBinding_IOrganizationService">"
   node.
2) Copy all of the child nodes in the "<binding name="CustomBinding_IOrganizationService">" node and overwrite
   the current child nodes of the "<binding name="CustomBinding_IDiscoveryService">" in order to ensure that
   the Discovery Service and Organization Service have the same configuration.
   NOTE: When adding the two services, the configuration for the Discovery Service is removed (incorrectly).
3) If needed, update the addresses in the "<endpoint ...>" nodes for each service.

CODE CHANGES
1) Open Program.cs and update the UserDomain, UserName, UserPassword, DiscoveryServiceUrl, 
   and OrganizationUniqueName constants.
   NOTE: These values are only required in order to make the sample work.
