DEPENDENCIES
- Microsoft.IdentityModel.dll: This is the same assembly that is required by Micrososft.Xrm.Sdk.dll in order to 
  authenticate against a claims environment.
- DeviceIdManager.cs: Sample which manages Device credentials
- WsdlTokenManager.cs: Sample that authenticates a user with CRM without a dependency on Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.dll

SERVICE REFERENCES
Add the following service references, using your server name:

1) Example URL: https://disco.crm.dynamics.com/XRMServices/2011/Discovery.svc?WSDL
   Namespace: CrmSdk.Discovery
   Notes: The URL may not resolve correctly in Visual Studio without the "?WSDL".
2) Example URL: https://orgname.api.crm.dynamics.com/XRMServices/2011/Organization.svc?WSDL
   Namespace: CrmSdk
   Notes: The URL may not resolve correctly in Visual Studio without the "?WSDL".

If you don't know the URL for the services, do the following:
1) Launch the CRM Application in Internet Explorer
2) Navigate to Settings -> Customizations
3) Click Developer Resources
4) Note down the URL for the Discovery Service and the Organization Service.

Important: Starting with CRM Online 2015 Update 1 and later, the syntax for the URL's to use when creating a
service reference has changed slightly. The end of the URL, which was "?WSDL", should be changed to 
"?singleWSDL&sdkversion=7.1". 

    For example: https://disco.crm.dynamics.com/XRMServices/2011/Discovery.svc?singleWSDL&sdkversion=7.1

Failure to use this syntax may result in the following error:
"Failed to generate code for the service reference with 
'http://schemas.microsoft.com/xrm/7.1/Metadata:ArrayOfEntityKeyMetadata' is not declared"

CONFIGURATION FILE CHANGES
1) In the "<binding name="CustomBinding_IOrganizationService">" node, remove the commented sections.
   NOTE: The TransportSecurityElement fails to generate because the Windows Live STS does not return
         all of the correct metadata.
2) If needed, update the addresses in the "<endpoint ...>" nodes for each service.

CODE CHANGES
1) Open Program.cs and update the UserName, UserPassword, DiscoveryServiceUrl, and OrganizationUniqueName constants.
   NOTE: These values are only required in order to make the sample work.

ADDITIONAL FILES
- ClientBaseExtensions.cs: Additional file that will configure the ClientBase<T> classes for CRM Online.
